Create Cloud Drive Utility

This is a simple utility to create a cloud-config drive for junos devices.

Junos requires a USB disk be formatted with msdos that contains a default configuration.
This simply creates a templatized junos configuration based on some entries in the
device_parms.yaml file and creates the image.
